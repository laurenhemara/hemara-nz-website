  abstract = {A pandemic isolate of Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae biovar 3 (Psa3) has devastated kiwifruit orchards growing cultivars of Actinidia chinensis. In contrast, A. arguta (kiwiberry) is not a host of Psa3. Resistance is mediated via effector-triggered immunity, as demonstrated by induction of the hypersensitive response in infected A. arguta leaves, observed by microscopy and quantified by ion-leakage assays. Isolates of Psa3 that cause disease in A. arguta have been isolated and analyzed, revealing a 51 kb deletion in the exchangeable effector locus (EEL). This natural EEL-mutant isolate and strains with synthetic knockouts of the EEL were more virulent in A. arguta plantlets than wild-type Psa3. Screening of a complete library of Psa3 effector knockout strains identified increased growth in planta for knockouts of four effectors\textendash AvrRpm1a, HopF1c, HopZ5a, and the EEL effector HopAW1a \textendash suggesting a resistance response in A. arguta. Hypersensitive response (HR) assays indicate that three of these effectors trigger a host species-specific HR. A Psa3 strain with all four effectors knocked out escaped host recognition, but a cumulative increase in bacterial pathogenicity and virulence was not observed. These avirulence effectors can be used in turn to identify the first cognate resistance genes in Actinidia for breeding durable resistance into future kiwifruit cultivars.},

  abstract = {Testing effector knockout strains of the Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae biovar 3 (Psa3) for reduced in planta growth in their native kiwifruit host revealed a number of nonredundant effectors that contribute to Psa3 virulence. Conversely, complementation in the weak kiwifruit pathogen P. syringae pv. actinidifoliorum (Pfm) for increased growth identified redundant Psa3 effectors. Psa3 effectors hopAZ1a and HopS2b and the entire exchangeable effector locus ({$\Delta$}EEL; 10 effectors) were significant contributors to bacterial colonisation of the host and were additive in their effects on virulence. Four of the EEL effectors (HopD1a, AvrB2b, HopAW1a and HopD2a) redundantly contribute to virulence through suppression of pattern-triggered immunity (PTI). Important Psa3 effectors include several redundantly required effectors early in the infection process (HopZ5a, HopH1a, AvrPto1b, AvrRpm1a and HopF1e). These largely target the plant immunity hub, RIN4. This comprehensive effector profiling revealed that Psa3 carries robust effector redundancy for a large portion of its effectors, covering a few functions critical to disease.},

  abstract = {Summary The common polysaccharide antigen (CPA) of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Pseudomonas syringae is highly variable, but the genetic basis for this is poorly understood. We have characterized the CPA locus from P. syringae pv. actinidiae (Psa). This locus has genes for l- and d-rhamnose biosynthesis and an operon coding for ABC transporter subunits, a bifunctional glycosyltransferase and an o-methyltransferase. This operon is predicted to have a role in the transport, elongation and termination of the CPA oligosaccharide and is referred to as the TET operon. Two alleles of the TET operon were present in different biovars (BV) of Psa and lineages of the closely related pathovar P. syringae pv. actinidifoliorum. This allelic variation was reflected in the electrophoretic properties of purified LPS from the different isolates. Gene knockout of the TET operon allele from BV1 and replacement with that from BV3, demonstrated the link between the genetic locus and the biochemical properties of the LPS molecules in Psa. Sequence analysis of the TET operon from a range of P. syringae and P. viridiflava isolates displayed a phylogenetic history incongruent with core gene phylogeny but correlates with previously reported tailocin sensitivity, suggesting a functional relationship between LPS structure and tailocin susceptibility.},
