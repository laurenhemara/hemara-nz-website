abstract: Testing effector knockout strains of {{< hl >}}*Pseudomonas syringae* pv.
  *actinidiae* biovar 3 (Psa3){{</ hl >}} for reduced in planta growth in their native
  kiwifruit host revealed a number of nonredundant effectors that contribute to
  Psa3 virulence. Conversely, complementation in the weak kiwifruit pathogen {{< hl >}}*P.
  syringae* pv. *actinidifoliorum* (Pfm){{</ hl >}} for increased growth identified
  redundant Psa3 effectors. Psa3 effectors hopAZ1a and HopS2b and the entire
  exchangeable effector locus (Î”EEL; 10 effectors) were significant contributors
  to bacterial colonisation of the host and were additive in their effects on
  virulence. Four of the EEL effectors (HopD1a, AvrB2b, HopAW1a and HopD2a)
  redundantly contribute to virulence through suppression of pattern-triggered
  immunity (PTI). Important Psa3 effectors include several redundantly required
  effectors early in the infection process (HopZ5a, HopH1a, AvrPto1b, AvrRpm1a
  and HopF1e). These largely target the plant immunity hub, RIN4. This
  comprehensive effector profiling revealed that Psa3 carries robust effector
  redundancy for a large portion of its effectors, covering a few functions
  critical to disease.
