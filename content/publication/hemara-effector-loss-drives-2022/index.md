abstract: A pandemic isolate of *Pseudomonas syringae* pv. *actinidiae* biovar 3 (Psa3)
  has devastated kiwifruit orchards growing cultivars of *Actinidia chinensis*. In contrast, *A. 
  arguta* (kiwiberry) is not a host of Psa3. Resistance is mediated via effector-triggered
  immunity, as demonstrated by induction of the hypersensitive response in infected *A.
  arguta* leaves, observed by microscopy and quantified by ion-leakage assays. Isolates
  of Psa3 that cause disease in *A. arguta* have been isolated and analyzed, revealing
  a 51 kb deletion in the exchangeable effector locus (EEL). This natural EEL-mutant
  isolate and strains with synthetic knockouts of the EEL were more virulent in A.
  arguta plantlets than wild-type Psa3. Screening of a complete library of Psa3 effector
  knockout strains identified increased growth in planta for knockouts of four effectors -
  AvrRpm1a, HopF1c, HopZ5a, and the EEL effector HopAW1a - suggesting a resistance
  response in *A. arguta*. Hypersensitive response (HR) assays indicate that three of
  these effectors trigger a host species-specific HR. A Psa3 strain with all four
  effectors knocked out escaped host recognition, but a cumulative increase in bacterial
  pathogenicity and virulence was not observed. These avirulence effectors can be
  used in turn to identify the first cognate resistance genes in *Actinidia* for breeding
  durable resistance into future kiwifruit cultivars.
