abstract: Summary The common polysaccharide antigen (CPA) of the lipopolysaccharide
  (LPS) from *Pseudomonas syringae* is highly variable, but the genetic basis for this
  is poorly understood. We have characterized the CPA locus from *P. syringae* pv. *actinidiae*
  (Psa). This locus has genes for l- and d-rhamnose biosynthesis and an operon coding
  for ABC transporter subunits, a bifunctional glycosyltransferase and an o-methyltransferase.
  This operon is predicted to have a role in the transport, elongation and termination
  of the CPA oligosaccharide and is referred to as the TET operon. Two alleles of
  the TET operon were present in different biovars (BV) of Psa and lineages of the
  closely related pathovar *P. syringae* pv. *actinidifoliorum*. This allelic variation
  was reflected in the electrophoretic properties of purified LPS from the different
  isolates. Gene knockout of the TET operon allele from BV1 and replacement with that
  from BV3, demonstrated the link between the genetic locus and the biochemical properties
  of the LPS molecules in Psa. Sequence analysis of the TET operon from a range of *P. 
  syringae* and *P. viridiflava* isolates displayed a phylogenetic history incongruent
  with core gene phylogeny but correlates with previously reported tailocin sensitivity,
  suggesting a functional relationship between LPS structure and tailocin susceptibility.
