abstract: Testing effector knockout strains of the *Pseudomonas syringae* pv. *actinidiae*
  biovar 3 (Psa3) for reduced in planta growth in their native kiwifruit host revealed
  a number of nonredundant effectors that contribute to Psa3 virulence. Conversely,
  complementation in the weak kiwifruit pathogen P. syringae pv. actinidifoliorum
  (Pfm) for increased growth identified redundant Psa3 effectors. Psa3 effectors hopAZ1a
  and HopS2b and the entire exchangeable effector locus ($Î”$EEL; 10 effectors) were
  significant contributors to bacterial colonisation of the host and were additive
  in their effects on virulence. Four of the EEL effectors (HopD1a, AvrB2b, HopAW1a
  and HopD2a) redundantly contribute to virulence through suppression of pattern-triggered
  immunity (PTI). Important Psa3 effectors include several redundantly required effectors
  early in the infection process (HopZ5a, HopH1a, AvrPto1b, AvrRpm1a and HopF1e).
  These largely target the plant immunity hub, RIN4. This comprehensive effector profiling
  revealed that Psa3 carries robust effector redundancy for a large portion of its
  effectors, covering a few functions critical to disease.
