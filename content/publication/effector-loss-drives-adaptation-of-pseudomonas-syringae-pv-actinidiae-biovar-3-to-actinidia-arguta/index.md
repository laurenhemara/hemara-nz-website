abstract: 'A pandemic isolate of *Pseudomonas syringae* pv. *actinidiae* biovar 3
  (Psa3) has devastated kiwifruit orchards growing cultivars of *Actinidia
  chinensis*. In contrast, *A. arguta* (kiwiberry) is not a host of Psa3.
  Resistance is mediated via effector-triggered immunity, as demonstrated by
  induction of the hypersensitive response in infected *A. arguta* leaves,
  observed by microscopy and quantified by ion-leakage assays. Isolates of Psa3
  that cause disease in *A. arguta* have been isolated and analyzed, revealing a
  51 kb deletion in the exchangeable effector locus (EEL). This natural
  EEL-mutant isolate and strains with synthetic knockouts of the EEL were more
  virulent in *A. arguta* plantlets than wild-type Psa3. Screening of a complete
  library of Psa3 effector knockout strains identified increased growth in
  planta for knockouts of four effectors - AvrRpm1a, HopF1c, HopZ5a, and the EEL
  effector HopAW1a - suggesting a resistance response in *A. arguta*.
  Hypersensitive response (HR) assays indicate that three of these effectors
  trigger a host species-specific HR. A Psa3 strain with all four effectors
  knocked out escaped host recognition, but a cumulative increase in bacterial
  pathogenicity and virulence was not observed. These avirulence effectors can
  be used in turn to identify the first cognate resistance genes in *Actinidia*
  for breeding durable resistance into future kiwifruit cultivars.'
