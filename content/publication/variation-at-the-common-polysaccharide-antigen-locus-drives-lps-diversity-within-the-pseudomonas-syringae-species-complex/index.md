abstract: 'The common polysaccharide antigen (CPA) of the lipopolysaccharide
  (LPS) from *Pseudomonas syringae* is highly variable, but the genetic basis for
  this is poorly understood. We have characterized the CPA locus from *P.
  syringae* pv. *actinidiae* (Psa). This locus has genes for l- and d-rhamnose
  biosynthesis and an operon coding for ABC transporter subunits, a bifunctional
  glycosyltransferase and an o-methyltransferase. This operon is predicted to
  have a role in the transport, elongation and termination of the CPA
  oligosaccharide and is referred to as the TET operon. Two alleles of the TET
  operon were present in different biovars (BV) of Psa and lineages of the
  closely related pathovar *P. syringae* pv. *actinidifoliorum*. This allelic
  variation was reflected in the electrophoretic properties of purified LPS from
  the different isolates. Gene knockout of the TET operon allele from BV1 and
  replacement with that from BV3, demonstrated the link between the genetic
  locus and the biochemical properties of the LPS molecules in Psa. Sequence
  analysis of the TET operon from a range of *P. syringae* and *P. viridiflava*
  isolates displayed a phylogenetic history incongruent with core gene phylogeny
  but correlates with previously reported tailocin sensitivity, suggesting a
  functional relationship between LPS structure and tailocin susceptibility.'
